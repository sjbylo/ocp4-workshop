# Getting ready for the workshop

This workshop shows you how to build and use Linux containers and then how to run and manage these 
same container images on OpenShift.

## Fork the example application repository in GitHub

In some labs you are asked to make changes to the example application's source code. It is important you use
your `own copy of the GitHub repository`.

If not already, fork (copy) the example application repository so that you can make
source code changes.

1. Log into your own GitHub account (or create one) then
1. go to the example repository located here: https://github.com/sjbylo/flask-vote-app 
1. Click on the "Fork" button on the top right of the page. (Note, only fork from `sjbylo`).

GitHub will make a copy and you will see your own version of it in your own GitHub account.
Check that the URL now contains `your GitHub username` and not `sjbylo`!

Later on in the labs you will be asked to access your GitHub repository.  
To fetch the URL, click on the `Clone or download` button and copy & paste the URL into your
terminal when asked to.

Your repository's URL will look something like this:

```
https://github.com/ENTER_YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME_HERE/flask-vote-app.git
```
`In the labs, always remember to enter your own GitHub username!`

Later on in the labs, you will be asked to clone your source code using git. 
Don't worry if you don't have git installed on your laptop, you can use git inside the online lab environment.


## Use Docker on the server provided or on your laptop

Important: You should only use Docker running on your laptop if you have already pulled the required images
(centos and mysql) onto your laptop, as described below.

Otherwise, please use the `server provided`.  See the "Workshop notes" document, shown to you by
your trainer for information about how to access it.

## What you should do before starting the workshop!

Ensure you have the following before you start.

A) Absolute minimum requirements - access Docker & OpenShift via WiFi  
- A laptop with a modern up-to-date browser
- Ssh installed, e.g. PuTTY (for windows) 
- Wifi or other method to access the Internet
- Register for a free github.com account at https://github.com/join 
- Register for a free quay account at https://quay.io/

B) For the adventurous - install Docker on your laptop 
- A laptop which can run Docker 
    - [Docker for Windows](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/) or [Docker for Mac](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/install/) or on Linux, installed and working on the laptop 
- The following commands download a lot of data and must be completed successfully, before coming to the workshop:

```
docker pull docker.io/library/centos:7
docker pull docker.io/library/mysql:5.7.25 
```

- The following command should output "CentOS Linux release ...":

```
docker run -it --rm centos:7 cat /etc/redhat-release
