# Container Workshop with Docker and OpenShift

This workshop is an introduction to Linux containers and OpenShift.  You will learn how to use Docker to build, 
run and share your application via images, import them into OpenShift to run securly and at scale. 

## What you will learn
- Learn about Linux containers and how to create container images you can run on your laptop and publish 
securely for use in other environments. 
- Understand the importance of container platforms like Kubernetes and how OpenShift uses Kubernetes, Docker and many other tools to create a complete platform “distribution” with everything you need to develop and run containers at scale and in production.  
- Gain hands-on experience moving your containers to OpenShift and running them on the platform at scale. 
- Discover how to deploy your application into different environments for different types of testing. 
- Learn how to create a CI/CD pipeline for your application and how to update your application with zero downtime. 

## Prerequisites for this workshop 

- Experience using the terminal or command prompts
- Working knowledge of Linux (e.g. the shell and ssh)
- A basic understanding of web and database servers, particularly how they typically communicate, IPs, and ports.
